2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks dclk and clk_100 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks dclk] -to [get_clocks clk_100]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks dclk and clk_100 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks dclk] -to [get_clocks clk_100]
Related violations: <none>
